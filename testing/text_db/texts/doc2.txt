Accusations of Editorial Bias Rock the BBC

The BBC is embroiled in controversy over allegations of systemic editorial bias. An internal memo leaked to British media accused senior editorial staff of skewing coverage of key issues like Gaza, Trump’s speech, and social debates. The fallout has already led to the resignation of top leadership and has triggered a broader discussion about impartiality and governance at one of the world’s most influential broadcasters.
